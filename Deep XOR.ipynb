    "\n",

    "![Feedforward Neural Network2](./images/diagram_sm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the weights $W_1, W_2$ and basis $b_1, b_2$ are the coefficients to be learned, $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ is the input, $\\mathbf{h} = \\{h_1, h_2\\}$ is the content of the hidden layer, and $\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\{\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2\\}$ is the output of the network.\n",

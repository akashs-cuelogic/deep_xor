# Deep XOR

Because standard XOR is boring.

This is basically a little exercise I decided to go through to have a better understanding of how neural networks work. Here you'll find the derivation of all necessary equations and their implementation in numpy.

The whole thing is in the [notebook file](Deep XOR.ipynb).
